You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the 
surface and perimeter for multiple types of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.
 
The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate
the total sum for perimeter and for surface.

Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added
to the drawing tool. In case 2 similar shapes are added, an appropriate message should be printed to console.
