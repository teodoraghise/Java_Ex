 On your local system: define a database ("booking"), create the following tables:

"accommodation" with the following columns:

    -- id: int (primary key)
    -- type: varchar (32)
    -- bed_type: varchar (32)
    -- max_guests: int
    -- description: varchar (512)

"room_fair" with the following columns:
    -- id: int (primary key)
    -- value: double
    -- season: varchar (32)

"accommodation_to_room_fair_relation" with the following columns:
    -- id: int (primary key)
    -- id_accommodation: int (foreign key of accommodation)
    -- id_room_fair: int (foreign key of room fair)

-> write a unit test which inserts data in the tables using the prepared statement, taking into account the accommodation_to_room_fair_relation data
-> write a unit test which interrogates the database and print using the LOGGER the price for each room in the database

Observations:

- respect the table, column names and data types

- the "accommodation_to_room_fair_relation" table is a link table between rooms and prices and you will have to use the JOIN in query to interrogate

- to insert in the database, recommendation: PreparedStatement.executeUpdate()
