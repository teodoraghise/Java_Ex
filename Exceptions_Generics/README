1) Create a generic Calculator using the proper placeholder.
This can be done either directly in calculator but I would recommend using a generic interface alongside an implementation. 
What does this calculator have to do ? Do any operation +, -, *, /, reset, parentheses, %. Any numbers can be accepted.
Create two such calculators. What do they have in common ? Do we need an interface ?

2) Create 2 custom exceptions with status code and message.
One should be a checked and one should be an unchecked exception. 
Throw them in at least 1 case each and handle them accordingly. For the checked exception, 
one should be managed using try { } catch { } finally { } and one should be thrown above. Write at least 1 test for each exception.
